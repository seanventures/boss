=== GROK AUTONOMOUS BUILD UPDATE 2026-06-05T15:05:46Z ===
Product: BOSS (Business Operating System Sentinel)
Repo root: /Volumes/DataSSD1/test/boss
Git remote: https://github.com/seanheiney/boss (main default)
Base branch: main
Mission status: Discovery complete; .ai/ files initializing; working tree dirty with recent gap-closure diffs (KPI, budget endpoints, bootstrap gate, audit logging, route parity) matching docs/product/GAP_BACKLOG "Closed" entries. No P0 code bugs found in scan; 3 P0s externally Blocked per real-only posture.
Discovered spec sources: PRD-v2.0.md (governing), TECHNICAL_SPEC-v2.0.md, REQUIREMENT_INVENTORY.md, TRACEABILITY.md, GAP_BACKLOG.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, README, AGENTS.md, user-stories.md, specpack contracts, openapi, schema (see .ai/spec-index.md for full with confidence).
Active agents: ORCHESTRATOR (primary); others pending spawn.
Active branches/worktrees: codex/spec-closure-audit (dirty); none other.
Open PRs: 2 (cursor bot on main, Account Connect/SCIM); none for current branch.
Completed since last update: Repo root found, product=BOSS identified, GitHub gh+MCP ready, .ai/ dir created, spec-index.md + status.md written, todo list initialized, git diff captured (+602 lines gap work + new untracked kpi files).
Current P0/P1/P2/P3 gap counts: P0 closed-recent: ~5 (per docs); P0 open external-Blocked: 3 (Account Connect hosted, Enterprise IdP/SCIM, live ProviderOps rollout); P1:1 monitoring; P2+: polish/UX/e2e per upcoming reviews. Full rebuild pending.
Currently implementing: AI-FILES creation + baseline validation prep.
Product decisions made: Follow PRD-v2 constitution (receipts, reservations, leases, no silent, fail-closed, API-first, real-only, small PRs). Treat current dirty tree as "audit closure" work to be committed/validated/PR'd.
UX decisions made: (pending agent review)
Architecture decisions made: (pending; align to planes in TECH SPEC v2)
Security findings: (pending full scan; recent bootstrap gate + denial logging address prior P0s)
Tests run: 0 this session (baseline next)
Failures found: 0 new
Failures fixed: N/A
Conflicts found/resolved: None local vs Codex/human at start. Cursor PRs noted (unrelated to current changes).
Commits pushed: 0 this session
Codex handoff updated: Pending first full write
Next autonomous actions: Write remaining .ai/ (traceability, gap-backlog, codex-handoff, reviews stubs), run make lint/test/smoke (background where long), spawn agents via spawn_subagent, commit coherent changes to branch with req IDs (e.g. GAP-2026-06-05-00*), push, open PR via gh/MCP, iterate gaps/reviews.
Blockers: None true (externals are documented Blocked, not code); docker/postgres needed for full make test/smoke but can run unit/lint first.

=== GROK AUTONOMOUS BUILD UPDATE 2026-06-05T15:11:39Z ===
Product: BOSS (Business Operating System Sentinel)
Repo root: /Volumes/DataSSD1/test/boss
Git remote: https://github.com/seanheiney/boss (main default)
Base branch: main
Mission status: Baseline validation COMPLETE and GREEN for changed areas. .ai/ coordination files created (spec-index, status, activity, codex-handoff, traceability, gap-backlog, all reviews stubs, 9 agent files). P0 local gaps closed in pre-session diff (now validated). External P0s confirmed Blocked via make release-blockers.
Discovered spec sources: Confirmed (see .ai/spec-index.md).
Active agents: ORCHESTRATOR primary + 8 agent .md files created (PM, UX, Architect, FeatureEng, QA, Security, DevOps, CodexCoord). Spawn_subagent pending for active parallel work.
Active branches/worktrees: codex/spec-closure-audit (dirty with +602 gap-closure + .ai creations + kpi untracked).
Open PRs: Still 2 cursor on main.
Completed since last update: 
- All required .ai/ files written with full content (traceability matrix with DoD columns, gap backlog with P0/P1/P2/AUTO, reviews, handoff, agents).
- make lint: PASS (tsc + ruff).
- Targeted pytest (kpi|budget|bootstrap|denial|canonical|policy_denial): 24 passed.
- Web vitest (kpis + api-client + accessibility): 33 + 2 passed.
- pnpm build (web): PASS (production build ok).
- make release-blockers: confirms exactly the 3 external P0 Blocks (Account Connect, Enterprise IdP/SCIM, ProviderOps write) + community ready.
- make k8s-validate + infra-validate: PASS.
- make smoke: port conflict (expected, other postgres); units cover bootstrap/seed.
Tests run: lint, 24 API, 35 web, build, 3 make validators, release-blockers.
Failures found: 0.
Failures fixed: N/A (none found).
Conflicts found/resolved: None.
Commits pushed: 0 (next step).
Codex handoff updated: Will update now.
Next autonomous actions: 1. Update .ai/codex-handoff.md + agent .md with results. 2. Git add/commit the coherent audit changes + .ai files with req ID messages (GAP-2026-06-05-00* + PRD refs). 3. git push. 4. gh pr create (or MCP) with full PR desc per rules (reqs, behavior, files, decisions, tests, risks, Codex notes). 5. Spawn parallel subagents for deeper reviews (e.g. QA to add race tests, UX to audit states). 6. If reviews find P0/P1 local, fix via search_replace, retest, amend commit. 7. Continue to P2 polish or declare local complete + release-readiness. 8. 15min terminal print.
Blockers: Port conflict for full make smoke (non-blocking; use 56344 tests); external for 3 P0s (documented).
