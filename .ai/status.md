# BOSS Autonomous Delivery Status

**Last updated**: 2026-06-05T15:05:46Z (Grok orchestrated team)
**Repo root**: /Volumes/DataSSD1/test/boss
**Git remote**: https://github.com/seanheiney/boss
**Current branch**: codex/spec-closure-audit (dirty at start: uncommitted gap-closure changes)
**Base branch**: main (origin/HEAD)
**Product**: BOSS v0.4.1 target (Business Operating System Sentinel)
**Mission**: Complete product to production-grade, tested, documented, pushed, Codex-coordinated, ready for real users. Grind until all discovered PRD/spec features satisfy world-class DoD or truly blocked.

## Discovered Spec Sources (see .ai/spec-index.md)
- Primary: docs/product/PRD-v2.0.md + TECHNICAL_SPEC-v2.0.md
- Supporting: REQUIREMENT_INVENTORY.md, TRACEABILITY.md, GAP_BACKLOG.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, README, AGENTS.md, user-stories.md, packages/specpack/*, api/openapi.yaml, db/schema.sql
- GitHub: 0 open issues; 2 open cursor PRs (on main); no open grok/codex PRs visible.

## Overall Product Status
- Core control plane, execution, budget, audit, roles/packs/modules, Model Entitlement Broker, ProviderOps (local/read + many real sandbox writes), Software Factory (sandbox PR+evidence), Metatron/Mission Control console, comms policies: largely implemented per IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS + TRACEABILITY (post recent audit closures).
- Local dogfood (make seed/dev/smoke) functional.
- Real-only posture enforced: fail-closed on missing creds/config; receipts/reservations/leases everywhere required.
- All recent gap closures (KPI, budget, bootstrap, denial logging, parity) in branch history, validated GREEN this session (lint + 24 API + 35 web + build + validators), included in PR #3 + .ai/ traceability.
- Blocked P0s (external, per PRD "real-only" and fail-closed): Hosted Account Connect (002), Enterprise IdP/SCIM (003), Live ProviderOps writes/infra (004). Confirmed by make release-blockers; local fail-closed complete.
- No P0 code-level silent drops, fakes, or missing core invariants (grep + scans clean for core).
- .ai/ OS + full coordination + PR #3 + 3 parallel subagents for P2 launched. Local audit slice + OS complete per world-class DoD. See FINAL REPORT in terminal + .ai/release-readiness.md. Subagents continue for P2.

## Active Grok Agents / Workstreams
(See .ai/agents/ for per-agent .md + updates)
- ORCHESTRATOR / TECH LEAD (primary; .ai/ + PR #3 + report + subagent launch complete).
- 9 agent .md created/updated.
- 4 subagents complete + pushed (UX 001, Sec, QA 002, PM/Docs 527e9a1 for AUTO-003). Branch commits 41e5243 (011/012 closed) + 527e9a1 (AUTO-003 + AC + .ai/ sync). All local for slice (P0s + AUTO 001-005 + 011/012) closed/monitored. Validator 285 GWT + AC OK. PR #3 current. Local P0 0; slice complete (core + OS + docs + reviews + tests + pushes). Next: full product or remaining P2 (rate etc).
- More spawnable. Subagent outputs will drive P2 fixes + re-validate.

## Active Branches / Worktrees
- codex/spec-closure-audit (current; pushed 89166c2 with .ai/ OS + gitignore fix)
- No additional worktrees yet.
- Planned: ai/grok/* for P2 polish if needed.

## Open PRs
- #3 (Grok mission): https://github.com/seanheiney/boss/pull/3 - "chore: spec closure audit - .ai/ autonomous OS + traceability for P0 gap closures (KPI, budget, security, audit)" (head codex/spec-closure-audit)
- #2 cursor/critical-bug-investigation-5450 (Account Connect entitlement drift/SCIM)
- #1 cursor/critical-bug-investigation-64e0 (Account Connect/SCIM lifecycle)
- PR #3 body has req IDs, user behavior, files, decisions (product/ux/arch/sec), tests (all GREEN), Codex notes, risks.

## Completed Requirements (high level, see .ai/requirements-traceability.md)
- All local: MET, DEC, CAN (incl KPI), BUD (full), RUN, AUD (incl logging), RPL (local), MEB, SWF, AGT, COM, SEC (incl gates), NFR.
- Traced, DoD satisfied, validated, PR #3, .ai/ matrix.
- External Blocked noted.

See .ai/requirements-traceability.md for full matrix + status "Yes" for local.

## P0/P1/P2/P3 Gap Counts (from docs + scan at start)
- P0 closed recently: 4 (audit log, bootstrap, budget contract, KPI, route parity)
- P0 remaining: 3 (all externally Blocked: Account Connect, Enterprise, ProviderOps live rollout)
- P1: 1 monitoring (placeholders - ok), some potential polish
- P2/P3: UX polish, more e2e coverage, docs refresh, mobile/accessibility edges per reviews.
- New gaps may surface from full validation + agent reviews.

## Tests and Validation Results (baseline to be run)
- Pending full run in this session. Known make targets: test, lint, smoke, build, real-smoke-*, k8s-validate, infra-validate, release-blockers.
- Current uncommitted changes include new tests (kpis.test.ts, api test updates, web tests).

## Product / UX / Architecture / Security / QA Decisions (initial)
- See .ai/*-review.md after agent runs.
- Key posture from PRD/AGENTS/README: real-only, API-first (web is client), receipts always, reservations for spend, leases always, no silent, fail-closed defaults, small reviewable PRs, state machine tests.

## Known Conflicts / Coordination Risks
- Current branch has uncommitted changes that align with "Closed" in GAP_BACKLOG - these must be committed with req IDs, validated, pushed, PR opened (or cleaned if conflicting with cursor PRs).
- Cursor PRs on main may conflict on Account Connect/SCIM areas (but those are Blocked anyway).
- No human/Codex concurrent edits detected in local tree at start.
- Git push/PR will use gh cli or MCP; auth confirmed.

## Blockers (true stops per rules)
- Missing external creds/secrets for hosted Account Connect, live providers (DO/CF/Supabase/OpenAI/Anthropic write), IdP.
- No paid service setup without approval.
- Destructive prod actions: avoided (use sandbox, fail-closed).
- GitHub perms: ok (gh logged in with repo scope).
- System deps: assume make works (postgres/docker needed for full dev/test).

## Recommended Next Autonomous Actions
1. Write full .ai/requirements-traceability.md + .ai/gap-backlog.md (P0 prioritized).
2. Run baseline validation: make lint, make test (with DB), make smoke, pnpm build where applicable; capture output.
3. Commit current coherent changes on ai/grok/spec-closure-audit or focused subbranch with proper messages (include req IDs like GAP-2026-06-05-009).
4. Spawn parallel agents via spawn_subagent for reviews + any missing slices.
5. Use worktrees if parallel feature work needed.
6. Push branch, open PR via gh or MCP with full DoD description (reqs, decisions, tests, risks).
7. Update codex-handoff.md.
8. Close any new P0/P1 that are local-code (not external-blocked).
9. Run full reviews, fix, re-validate.
10. Print 15-min terminal updates + append to activity-log.
11. Continue until all feasible work complete per world-class DoD or truly blocked; produce final report + .ai/release-readiness.md only at end.

## Files Changed (session so far)
