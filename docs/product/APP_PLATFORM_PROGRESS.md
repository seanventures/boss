# App platform build: progress

Spec: [APP_TEMPLATES_AND_SECURITY_LOOP.md](APP_TEMPLATES_AND_SECURITY_LOOP.md) (§8 is the build plan).
Branch: `feat/app-platform` (worktree `~/src/boss-wt-appplat`). Push after every step.

## Stream S0: day-1 interfaces

| # | Step | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `db/schema.sql`: `-- BEGIN Fn … -- END Fn` blocks for F2, F4, F5, F6 with the tables the spec defines | done |
| 2 | Permission catalogue: the §8.2 permissions + regenerated files | done |
| 3 | Router stubs (`routes_templates.py`, `routes_security.py`, `routes_links.py`, `oidc_routes.py`), 501 `not_implemented_yet`, included in `main.py` | done |
| 4 | `engine/boss_engine/templates/manifest.py` (boss.template/v1, frozen) + unit tests | done |
| 5 | IDENTITY.md amendment for D10 (RS256 ID tokens for apps; EdDSA-only is BOSS-internal) | done |

### Notes per step

1. Schema. Every table §2.7, §2.4, §4.4, §5.2 and §6.3 lists column by column is created inside its
   feature's block (types inferred from the spec: ids TEXT, closed sets as CHECKs). Not specified
   column by column, left as `TODO(S6)` in the F6 block: `oidc_pool_user_factors`, `oidc_sessions`.
   `app_secret_bindings.mode`'s CHECK is table-level because the column reconcile in
   `boss_engine/db.py` cuts an inline definition at the word "generated". `ensure_schema` applied
   twice on a fresh database: 961/961 statements, no new reconcile skips.

2. Catalogue (`packages/identity/catalogue.yaml`, regenerated with
   `PYTHONPATH=engine python3 -m boss_engine.identity.codegen`). 180 → 192 permissions; the reviewed
   role sizes are updated in `engine/tests/test_identity_catalogue_is_generated.py` and
   `apps/web/tests/identity-contract.test.ts`.

   | Permission | Scope | Roles | Flags |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `template:read` | org | O A P V U | delegable |
   | `template:import` | org | O A P | — |
   | `template:approve` | org | O A (D3) | step-up, critical |
   | `app_secret:read_metadata` | project | O A P | delegable |
   | `app_secret:write` | project | O A P | step-up (D9: reveal test users is behind it) |
   | `app_secret:live` | project | O A | step-up, critical |
   | `security_scan:run` | project | O A P | delegable |
   | `security_finding:triage` | project | O A P | — (a person's judgment, not delegable) |
   | `oidc:admin` | org | O A | step-up, critical |
   | `oidc_client:manage` | project | O A P | step-up |
   | `oidc_pool_user:manage` | org | O A | step-up |
   | `oidc_app:sign_in` | project | O A P V | — (bound at a project = may sign in to its apps) |

   Not done (owner streams decide): no Passport preset holds a new permission yet. S2 decides whether
   the builder/planner presets get `template:read`; S4 whether the reviewer preset gets
   `security_scan:run`.

   The spec's `app_secret:read_meta` is named `app_secret:read_metadata` (the catalogue's read
   actions are `read`, `read_metadata`, `read_all`; the spec now says so too).

3. Router stubs. `apps/api/app/routes_templates.py` (S2), `routes_security.py` (S4),
   `routes_links.py` (S5), `oidc_routes.py` (S6), included at the end of `main.py` before the
   coverage check. 54 operations, all declared (coverage 1442/1442). Each answers 501
   `{"error": "not_implemented_yet", "owner": "<stream>", "spec": ...}`;
   `apps/api/tests/test_app_platform_day1_routes.py` pins that under enforce (owner reaches every
   stub; no credential reaches only `/oidc/*`; a viewer cannot import or approve). A stream that
   builds its routes updates that test.
   Decisions made here (S-owners may revisit):
   - App-level routes take `project_id` (query for GET/DELETE, body otherwise): an app key is
     unique per project only.
   - Link create/revoke use `project:update` (the spec's "project:write" does not exist). That is
     Owner/Admin + step-up: operators cannot link apps until S5 or the operator decides otherwise.
   - D9's reveal is `POST /v1/apps/{app_key}/test-users/reveal` (`app_secret:write`, step-up).
   - OIDC admin GETs are declared with the manage keys (no `oidc:read` exists; listed in
     `GET_NOT_READ` of `test_identity_authz_read_only.py`). Open question for S6: does the Auditor
     need an `oidc:read`?
   - Protocol routes: discovery and JWKS are `public:jwks`; authorize, token, userinfo,
     revocation and end_session are `public:oidc_provider_endpoint`, a new `PublicReason`
     (IDENTITY_BUILD.md §7, AP-2) with verifier `oidc_routes.verify_oidc_request` (S6).
     `/oidc/` joins SCIM and SAML as a foreign protocol outside the idempotency contract.
   - New object kinds (`identity/object_kinds.py`): `security_scan`, `security_finding` (project via
     its scan), `app_link`, `oidc_client` (so `oidc_clients.project_id`/`app_key` are NOT NULL: a
     client belongs to one app).
   - `app_secret:live` and `oidc_app:sign_in` are checked inside handlers, not by a route: listed
     in `RESERVED` of `test_identity_authz_catalogue_use.py`.
   Regenerate after any route change:
   `PYTHONPATH=.:engine python3 -m apps.api.tests.identity_matrix`,
   `PYTHONPATH=.:engine python3 apps/api/tests/test_identity_authz_public_routes.py`,
   `PYTHONPATH=.:engine python3 scripts/dump-identity-api-routes.py`.
   Known failure on the base, not from this work:
   `test_a_streaming_write_is_excluded_rather_than_buffered` (`POST /v1/agents/{role_key}/test`).

4. Manifest. `engine/boss_engine/templates/manifest.py`: `validate_manifest(text|dict)`,
   `load_manifest(path|dir)`, `TemplateManifest` (pydantic, frozen, `extra="forbid"`),
   `ManifestError.reasons` (one `<field>: <what is wrong>` line per problem, all at once).
   Checks the manifest alone: id/semver/word/env-name patterns, stacks ∈ node|python|java, a test
   command (junit, min_tests ≥ 1) for exactly the declared stacks, compilable secret patterns,
   egress = bare FQDNs (no wildcard, IP, scheme/port, local/reserved TLD), `METHOD /path` routes,
   relative guide/security paths, no self-reference, no duplicate names. The import's checks that
   need the repo or the install (tree, sizes, secret scan, built-in id clash, BOSS hosts in egress,
   who may set `insecure_by_design`) are S2's. Tests: `engine/tests/test_template_manifest.py`
   (45; the spec's example verbatim is valid; the field set is pinned).

5. D10. IDENTITY.md gains D35 and a paragraph under the token families: "EdDSA only" is for
   BOSS's own tokens; app ID tokens are RS256 by default, EdDSA per client, in a separate `oidc`
   key family neither side accepts from the other; D3 points at D35. The amendment log
   (docs/maintainers/IDENTITY_BUILD.md §7) records AP-1 (catalogue), AP-2 (`oidc_provider_endpoint`)
   and AP-3 (D35).

## What's next (after S0)

S0 is complete. Per §8.2 the next streams start in parallel against these interfaces: S2 (F2
engine/API: `engine/boss_engine/templates/` beyond `manifest.py`, `routes_templates.py`, the
`template_tests` gate, vault kind `app_secret`, which needs `identity_vault_items.kind`'s CHECK
widened in the identity block by amendment), S4, S5, S6, then the UI streams. Each stream edits only
its own schema block and router module, and updates `test_app_platform_day1_routes.py` as its
routes stop answering 501.

## Resume instructions

- `cd ~/src/boss-wt-appplat && git pull` (branch `feat/app-platform`).
- Pick up the first step above that is not `done`.
- Test DB: container `boss-test-pg` on localhost:55432, user `boss`; password via
  `docker exec boss-test-pg printenv POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (never print it). Create a private database
  (S0 used `boss_test_s0`) and drop it afterwards.
